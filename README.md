# Favourite-Things-List
A CRUD WebApp to display my favourite things - currently movies and songs.
Utilising PostgreSQL to create, update and delete items on demand and with ease.
Built using Python, Flask, Jinja, Bootstrap 5, and WTForms, together with the Google/YouTube API and TMDB API.
Data is stored on locally hosted PostgreSQL database and the site is deployed to an owned subdomain on my raspberry pi.
